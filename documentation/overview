Current Tasks
    1. add ability to restart
    2. create state system for car
    3. come up with basic AI input structure to have an AI control the car
    4. Implement Neural Network into AI

Objective
    This project will initially be a top down driving simulator, where you must stay in between the lines of the road,
    as you lose health if you crash into the walls. The user will be able to first build the track, adding a variety of
    different objects. Then, they will be able to drive the course themselves. Then, I will create a neural network in
    which an AI will learn how to successfully drive the car through the course.

Object Structure
    Config
    Game
        State
        Car
        Map
            Wall (+ other objects tdb)
        AI
        Neural Network

Object Descriptions
    Config
        list of all constants for the game/game launcher

    Game
        passes user input to alter the car/map, and then draws
        will eventually pass the AI input to the map

    Map
        Contains all of the obstacles which will be drawn (ie: walls, cones, etc.)

    State
        Map Creation, Driving, Paused

    AI
        TBD

    Neural Network
        TBD
