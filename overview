Objective
    This project will initially be a top down driving simulator, where you must stay in between the lines of the road,
    as you lose health if you crash into the walls. The user will be able to first build the track, adding a variety of
    different objects. Then, they will be able to drive the course themselves. Then, I will create a neural network in
    which an AI will learn how to successfully drive the car through the course.
